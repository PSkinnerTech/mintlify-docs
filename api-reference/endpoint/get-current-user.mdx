## Overview

Returns detailed information about the currently authenticated user, including their profile, role, and organization memberships. This endpoint is commonly used to verify authentication status and retrieve user context for applications.

## Usage Examples

### Get Current User Information
Retrieve information about the authenticated user:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://core.timebackapi.com/auth/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Using API Key Authentication
Alternative authentication method:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://core.timebackapi.com/auth/me" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Example
Using the TimeBack SDK:

```typescript
import { TimeBackClient } from '@timeback/sdk';

const client = new TimeBackClient({
  apiKey: 'your-jwt-token',
  baseUrl: 'https://core.timebackapi.com'
});

const currentUser = await client.auth.me();
console.log('Current user:', currentUser);
```

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized - Invalid Token
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH001",
    "message": "Invalid or missing authentication token"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-25T10:30:00Z",
    "requestId": "req_1234567890"
  }
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized - Expired Token
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH002",
    "message": "Authentication token has expired"
  }
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### Authentication Verification
Check if the current token is valid and get user context:

```javascript
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/auth/me', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    const userData = await response.json();
    console.log('User is authenticated:', userData.data.user);
  } else {
    // Redirect to login
    window.location.href = '/login';
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Authentication check failed:', error);
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control
Determine user permissions based on role:

```javascript
const user = currentUserResponse.data.user;

const canManageUsers = ['admin', 'superadmin'].includes(user.role);
const canAccessAllOrgs = user.role === 'superadmin';
const userOrganizations = user.organizationIds;

// Show/hide UI elements based on permissions
if (canManageUsers) {
  showUserManagementSection();
}
```

### Organization Context
Filter data based on user's organization access:

```javascript
const userOrgs = currentUser.data.user.organizationIds;

// Fetch students only from user's organizations
const students = await api.get('/students', {
  params: { organizationId: userOrgs.join(',') }
});
```

## Security Notes

- This endpoint always requires authentication
- The response contains sensitive user information
- Use HTTPS in production to protect user data in transit
- Token validation occurs on every request to this endpoint
- Consider caching user information client-side to reduce API calls
