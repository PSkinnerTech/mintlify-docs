## Access Control

- Only users with administrator privileges can delete students
- API keys must have student deletion permissions
- Users can only delete students within their permitted organizations

## Data Deletion Impact

When a student is deleted, the following data is permanently removed:

### Student Profile Data
- Personal information (name, email, grade level)
- Account settings and preferences
- Organization memberships

### Academic Records
- All grade book entries and results
- Assignment submissions and feedback
- Progress tracking and analytics

### Learning Data
- TimeBack XP points and mastery levels
- Learning pattern analysis
- Personalized recommendations

### System Records
- Authentication tokens and sessions
- API access logs (student-specific)
- Audit trail entries

## Recommended Alternative

Instead of deletion, consider **deactivating** the student account:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://core.timebackapi.com/students/student-123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "isActive": false
  }'
```

Deactivation preserves data while preventing system access, allowing for potential reactivation in the future.

## Best Practices

1. **Verify Intent**: Confirm deletion is truly necessary
2. **Export Data**: Download student records if needed for compliance
3. **Remove Dependencies**: Clear active enrollments before deletion
4. **Documentation**: Log the deletion reason for audit purposes
5. **Consider Deactivation**: Use account deactivation instead when possible
