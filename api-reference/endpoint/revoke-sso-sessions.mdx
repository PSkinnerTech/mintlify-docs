title: "Revoke all SSO sessions"
api: "DELETE /api/auth/sessions/revoke"
description: "Revoke all SSO sessions for the current user (logout everywhere)"
---

## Description

Revokes all active SSO sessions for the current user across all domains and devices. This is equivalent to "logout everywhere" functionality, providing a secure way to terminate all active sessions.

## Response

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "Sessions revoked": {
      "message": "All SSO sessions have been successfully revoked"
    }
  }
}
```

</ResponseExample>

## Error Responses

<ResponseExample>

```json 401 Unauthorized
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Authentication required"
  }
}
```

</ResponseExample>

## Behavior

When this endpoint is called:

1. **All Sessions Terminated**: Every active SSO session for the user is invalidated
2. **Cross-Domain Effect**: Sessions are revoked across all domains in the SSO network
3. **Immediate Effect**: Changes take effect immediately across all applications
4. **Token Invalidation**: All associated JWT tokens become invalid
5. **Re-authentication Required**: User must log in again on all applications

## Use Cases

- **Security Incident**: Quickly secure account after suspected compromise
- **Device Loss**: Revoke sessions when a device is lost or stolen
- **Logout Everywhere**: Provide users with complete session control
- **Account Cleanup**: Clear all sessions when changing passwords or security settings
- **Administrative Action**: Force re-authentication for security purposes

## Security Considerations

- **Irreversible Action**: Once revoked, all sessions must be re-established
- **User Impact**: User will be logged out of all applications immediately
- **No Selective Revocation**: This endpoint revokes ALL sessions, not individual ones

## Best Practices

- **User Warning**: Inform users about the impact before calling this endpoint
- **Confirmation**: Consider requiring additional confirmation for this action
- **Logging**: Log session revocation events for security auditing
- **User Notification**: Consider notifying users via email about session revocation
