## Welcome to TimeBack API

TimeBack provides a comprehensive REST API platform designed specifically for educational technology integrations. Our API follows industry standards and provides robust tools for managing students, classes, assessments, and educational resources.

### API Documentation Approach

This API reference documentation is built using [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) specifications with interactive examples. The TimeBack API is designed around REST principles with predictable, resource-oriented URLs.
