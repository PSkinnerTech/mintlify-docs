## OneRoster v1.2 Integration

TimeBack provides full compliance with OneRoster v1.2 standards, ensuring seamless integration with existing Student Information Systems (SIS) and educational data management platforms.

## What is OneRoster?

OneRoster is an educational data standard developed by 1EdTech Consortium that enables the secure exchange of class rosters, course information, and gradebook data between educational technology applications.

## TimeBack's OneRoster Implementation

### Organizational Hierarchy

TimeBack supports the complete OneRoster organizational structure:

**Districts**
- Top-level organizational units
- Multi-campus management
- District-wide policies and settings

**Schools**
- Individual campus entities
- School-specific configurations
- Local administrative control

**Classes**
- Specific course instances
- Teacher and student assignments
- Schedule and location management

### Core Data Models

#### Organizations
```typescript
interface Organization {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: "district" | "school" | "department";
  parentId?: string;
  identifier?: string; // NCES ID or similar
  status: "active" | "tobedeleted";
}
```

#### Academic Sessions
- **School Years**: Annual academic periods
- **Terms**: Semesters, quarters, or custom periods
- **Grading Periods**: Assessment timeframes
- **Class Periods**: Daily schedule slots

#### Courses and Classes
```typescript
interface Course {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  courseCode: string;
  grades: string[];
  subjects: string[];
  orgId: string;
  status: "active" | "tobedeleted";
}

interface Class {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  classCode: string;
  classType: "homeroom" | "scheduled";
  location?: string;
  courseId: string;
  schoolId: string;
  termIds: string[];
  periods?: string[];
  status: "active" | "tobedeleted";
}
```

#### Users and Enrollments
- **Students**: Learner accounts with grade levels
- **Teachers**: Educator accounts with subject specializations
- **Administrators**: Campus and district management roles
- **Enrollments**: User-to-class relationships with roles

## OneRoster API Endpoints

TimeBack exposes complete OneRoster v1.2 REST APIs:

### Rostering Endpoints

## TimeBack-Specific Extensions

### Enhanced Metadata
TimeBack extends OneRoster with educational optimization data:

```json
{
  "timeback.xp": 150,
  "timeback.masteryLevel": "proficient",
  "timeback.attemptCount": 2,
  "timeback.timeSpent": 2400,
  "timeback.learningVelocity": 0.85,
  "timeback.nextRecommendation": "algebra-2-intro"
}
```

### Learning Analytics Integration
- Time-on-task tracking for each assignment
- Mastery progression indicators
- Learning velocity calculations
- Personalized learning path data

## Data Synchronization

### Automated Sync
- Real-time updates from SIS systems
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Conflict resolution and error handling
- Data validation and integrity checks

### Sync Configuration
```typescript
interface SyncConfig {
  source: "sis" | "manual" | "api";
  frequency: "realtime" | "hourly" | "daily";
  scope: string[]; // Organizations to sync
  enabled: boolean;
}
```

## Compliance and Standards

### OneRoster v1.2 Certification
- Full compliance with OneRoster v1.2 specification
- Certified data exchange patterns
- Standard error handling and responses
- OAuth 2.0 authentication support

### Educational Privacy
- FERPA compliance for student data

## Implementation Examples

### Syncing Class Rosters
```typescript
// Fetch current enrollments for a class
const enrollments = await fetch('/ims/oneroster/v1p2/enrollments?filter=classId="class-math-6-01"');

// Process enrollments with TimeBack extensions
enrollments.forEach(enrollment => {
  if (enrollment.role === 'student') {
    // Track student learning metrics
    updateLearningAnalytics(enrollment.userId, enrollment.classId);
  }
});
```

### Grade Passback Integration
```typescript
// Create gradebook line item
const lineItem = {
  id: "lineitem-quiz-1",
  title: "Chapter 1 Quiz",
  classId: "class-math-6-01",
  categoryId: "category-assessments",
  resultValueMax: "100",
  assignDate: "2024-01-15",
  dueDate: "2024-01-22"
};

// Submit student result with TimeBack extensions
const result = {
  lineItemId: "lineitem-quiz-1",
  studentId: "student-123",
  score: "88",
  metadata: {
    "timeback.xp": 150,
    "timeback.masteryLevel": "proficient",
    "timeback.timeSpent": 1800
  }
};
```

TimeBack's OneRoster integration ensures that all educational data flows seamlessly while maintaining the highest standards for privacy, security, and educational effectiveness.
