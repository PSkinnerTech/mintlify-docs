## Assessment & Gradebook System

TimeBack's assessment and gradebook system goes beyond traditional grade recording to provide comprehensive learning analytics, mastery tracking, and gamified learning experiences.

## Core Components

### Grade Categories
Organize assessments into meaningful categories for better analysis:

```typescript
interface Category {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  status: "active" | "tobedeleted";
  dateLastModified?: Date;
}
```

**Standard Categories:**
- **Homework**: Daily assignments and practice work
- **Tests & Quizzes**: Formal assessments
- **Class Participation**: Engagement and interaction
- **Projects**: Long-term assignments
- **Lab Work**: Hands-on learning activities

### Line Items (Assignments)
Individual assessments with rich metadata:

```typescript
interface LineItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  classId: string;
  categoryId: string;
  assignDate: Date;
  dueDate: Date;
  resultValueMin: string;
  resultValueMax: string;
  status: "active" | "tobedeleted";
}
```

### Results with TimeBack Extensions
Student results enhanced with learning analytics:

```typescript
interface Result {
  id: string;
  lineItemId: string;
  studentId: string;
  scoreStatus: "exempt" | "tobeGraded" | "partiallyGraded" | "fullyGraded";
  score?: string;
  scoreDate?: Date;
  comment?: string;
  status: "active" | "tobedeleted";
  metadata?: {
    'timeback.xp': number;
    'timeback.masteryLevel': MasteryLevel;
    'timeback.attemptCount': number;
    'timeback.timeSpent': number; // seconds
    'timeback.learningVelocity'?: number;
  };
}
```

## Mastery Level System

TimeBack tracks student mastery beyond simple grades:

### Mastery Levels
- **not-started**: Assignment not yet attempted
- **in-progress**: Currently working on the material
- **developing**: Basic understanding demonstrated
- **proficient**: Solid grasp of concepts
- **advanced**: Exceeds expectations
- **mastery**: Complete understanding achieved

### Mastery Progression
```typescript
interface MasteryProgression {
  conceptId: string;
  currentLevel: MasteryLevel;
  progression: {
    level: MasteryLevel;
    achievedDate: Date;
    evidence: string[]; // Assignment IDs
  }[];
  timeToMastery: number; // seconds
}
```

## Experience Points (XP) System

### XP Calculation
XP is awarded based on multiple factors:

```typescript
function calculateXP(result: Result, context: AssignmentContext): number {
  const baseXP = Math.floor((result.score / result.maxScore) * 100);
  
  // Mastery bonus
  const masteryMultiplier = {
    'developing': 1.0,
    'proficient': 1.2,
    'advanced': 1.5,
    'mastery': 2.0
  };
  
  // Time efficiency bonus
  const timeBonus = context.expectedTime > result.timeSpent ? 1.1 : 1.0;
  
  // Attempt penalty (first attempt = no penalty)
  const attemptPenalty = Math.max(0.5, 1.0 - (result.attemptCount - 1) * 0.1);
  
  return Math.round(baseXP * masteryMultiplier[result.masteryLevel] * timeBonus * attemptPenalty);
}
```

### XP Categories
- **Assignment XP**: Individual assignment completion
- **Mastery XP**: Achieving mastery levels
- **Streak XP**: Consecutive successful completions
- **Efficiency XP**: Completing work in optimal time
- **Help XP**: Assisting other students

## Advanced Analytics

### Learning Velocity Tracking
Monitor how quickly students progress through material:

```typescript
interface LearningVelocity {
  studentId: string;
  subjectId: string;
  conceptsPerHour: number;
  masteryRate: number; // percentage reaching proficiency
  averageAttempts: number;
  trendDirection: "improving" | "stable" | "declining";
}
```

### Time-on-Task Analysis
Detailed tracking of student engagement:

```sql
-- Example query for time analysis
SELECT 
  student_id,
  line_item_id,
  AVG((metadata->>'timeback.timeSpent')::int) as avg_time_spent,
  COUNT(*) as attempt_count,
  MAX(score::int) as best_score
FROM results 
WHERE metadata ? 'timeback.timeSpent'
GROUP BY student_id, line_item_id;
```

### Mastery Distribution
Track mastery across classes and concepts:

```typescript
interface MasteryDistribution {
  classId: string;
  conceptId: string;
  distribution: {
    [key in MasteryLevel]: number;
  };
  averageTimeToMastery: number;
  strugglingStudents: string[]; // Student IDs below expected progress
}
```

## Gradebook Features

### Weighted Grading
Support for complex grading schemes:

```typescript
interface GradingScheme {
  categoryWeights: {
    [categoryId: string]: number; // percentage weight
  };
  dropLowest?: {
    [categoryId: string]: number; // number to drop
  };
  extraCredit: boolean;
  scalingFactors?: {
    [categoryId: string]: number;
  };
}
```

### Grade Calculations
Real-time grade computation with multiple options:

```typescript
function calculateGrade(
  results: Result[], 
  scheme: GradingScheme,
  options: GradeOptions
): GradeResult {
  // Group by category
  const categoryScores = groupByCategory(results);
  
  // Apply category weights
  let weightedTotal = 0;
  let totalWeight = 0;
  
  for (const [categoryId, scores] of categoryScores) {
    const weight = scheme.categoryWeights[categoryId] || 0;
    const categoryAverage = calculateCategoryAverage(scores, scheme);
    
    weightedTotal += categoryAverage * weight;
    totalWeight += weight;
  }
  
  return {
    numericGrade: weightedTotal / totalWeight,
    letterGrade: convertToLetterGrade(weightedTotal / totalWeight),
    masteryLevel: calculateOverallMastery(results),
    totalXP: results.reduce((sum, r) => sum + (r.metadata?.['timeback.xp'] || 0), 0)
  };
}
```

## Real-Time Feedback

### Instant Score Processing
Results are processed immediately upon submission:

1. **Score Validation**: Ensure scores are within valid ranges
2. **XP Calculation**: Award experience points based on performance
3. **Mastery Assessment**: Update mastery level progression
4. **Analytics Update**: Refresh learning velocity and time metrics
5. **Notification Dispatch**: Alert students, teachers, and parents

### Progress Visualization
Students can track their progress in real-time:

```typescript
interface ProgressDashboard {
  overallGrade: number;
  masteryDistribution: MasteryLevel[];
  xpEarned: number;
  xpToNextLevel: number;
  conceptsMastered: number;
  timeSpentLearning: number;
  streakCount: number;
}
```
