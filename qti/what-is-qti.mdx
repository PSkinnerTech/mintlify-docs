## What is QTI?

**Question & Test Interoperability (QTI)** is an open standard specification developed by [1EdTech Consortium](https://www.1edtech.org/standards/qti) (formerly IMS Global Learning Consortium) that enables the exchange of assessment content and data between different educational technology systems.

## Core Purpose

QTI solves a fundamental problem in educational technology: **assessment vendor lock-in**. Before QTI, educational institutions were often trapped with specific assessment tools because their content couldn't be easily moved between different systems.

### What QTI Provides

- **Content Portability**: Move tests and questions between different authoring tools, LMS platforms, and delivery systems
- **Presentation Consistency**: Standardized rendering of assessments across different applications
- **Secure Exchange**: Safe transfer of assessment content while maintaining institutional ownership
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Built-in support for Section 508 and WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Results Interoperability**: Standardized reporting of assessment results and analytics

## How QTI Works

QTI is fundamentally an **XML-based packaging format** that describes:

### Assessment Structure
```xml
<!-- QTI defines assessments, sections, and individual items -->
<qti-assessment-test>
  <qti-test-part>
    <qti-assessment-section>
      <qti-assessment-item-ref identifier="item1"/>
    </qti-assessment-section>
  </qti-test-part>
</qti-assessment-test>
```

### Rich Interaction Types
- Multiple choice, true/false
- Fill-in-the-blank and essay responses
- Drag-and-drop interactions
- Graphical interactions (hotspot, drawing)
- Mathematical expressions
- Custom portable interactions

### Advanced Assessment Features
- **Response Processing**: Complex scoring logic and algorithms
- **Adaptive Testing**: Questions that change based on previous responses
- **Item Templating**: Dynamic question generation with variables
- **Feedback Systems**: Immediate, contextual feedback to learners
- **Accessibility Features**: Screen reader support, alternative formats

## QTI Versions

### QTI 3.0 (Current)
- **Released**: May 2022
- **Key Features**: 
  - Web-friendly markup with standard HTML5 components
  - Enhanced Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) support
  - Improved Portable Custom Interactions (PCIs)
  - Better accessibility and Personal Needs & Preferences (PNP)
  - Unified specification combining QTI 2.x and APIP

### QTI 2.2
- **Released**: September 2015
- **Features**: HTML5 support, enhanced metadata, usage data reporting
- **Status**: Widely adopted, still in use

### Earlier Versions
- **QTI 2.1** (2012): Added test-level features, response processing
- **QTI 2.0** (2005): Major rewrite with new interaction model
- **QTI 1.2** (2002): Original specification

## QTI vs. Simple HTML Forms

QTI is **much richer** than basic HTML forms because it includes:

| Feature | HTML Forms | QTI |
|---------|------------|-----|
| **Context/Metadata** | None | Rich metadata, learning objectives |
| **Response Details** | Basic validation | Complex response processing |
| **Scoring Logic** | Manual | Automated with sophisticated algorithms |
| **Usage Analytics** | None | Item difficulty, statistics, learning analytics |
| **Accessibility** | Manual implementation | Built-in WCAG compliance |
| **Adaptivity** | Static | Dynamic, adaptive questioning |

## Benefits for Educational Institutions

### For Schools & Universities
- **Vendor Freedom**: Switch between assessment tools without losing content
- **Cost Savings**: Avoid vendor lock-in and negotiate better contracts
- **Quality Assurance**: Standardized assessment delivery and scoring
- **Compliance**: Built-in accessibility and privacy protections

### For Educators
- **Content Reuse**: Use the same questions across different platforms
- **Collaboration**: Share assessments with colleagues using different tools
- **Analytics**: Consistent reporting and learning analytics
- **Flexibility**: Choose the best tools for specific assessment needs

### For Developers & EdTech
- **Interoperability**: Build tools that work with existing QTI content
- **Standards Compliance**: Follow established best practices
- **Certification**: 1EdTech certification program ensures compatibility
- **Innovation**: Focus on features rather than proprietary formats

## QTI in the Alpha School Context

For Alpha School's educational technology stack, QTI provides:

### Assessment Integration
- **Seamless Testing**: Integrate with Alpha School's 2-hour learning model
- **Progress Tracking**: Align assessments with student progress APIs
