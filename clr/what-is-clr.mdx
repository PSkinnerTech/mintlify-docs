## What is CLR?

**CLR (Common Learning Resources)** is a standardized approach to educational content management and delivery. In the context of Alpha School's technology stack, CLR represents a unified system for organizing, accessing, and distributing learning materials across all educational platforms.

<Note>
The @superbuilders/clr package appears to be a specialized implementation for managing common learning resources within Alpha School's ecosystem.
</Note>

## Core Purpose

CLR solves the challenge of **educational content fragmentation** by providing:

### Unified Resource Management
- Centralized repository for all learning materials
- Consistent content structure across different subjects
- Standardized metadata for educational resources
- Version control for curriculum updates

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Seamless integration with Alpha School's learning management system
- Support for various content formats (text, video, interactive)
- API-driven access for different educational applications
- Mobile and web platform synchronization

## Key Features

### Content Organization
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Subjects → Units → Lessons → Resources
- **Tagging System**: Skill-based categorization for personalized learning
- **Difficulty Levels**: Adaptive content based on student progress
- **Prerequisites Mapping**: Clear learning path dependencies

### Resource Types
- **Text Materials**: Reading assignments, reference documents
- **Interactive Content**: Simulations, coding exercises, virtual labs
- **Assessment Items**: Quizzes, tests, project rubrics
- **Multimedia Assets**: Videos, audio recordings, images
- **Real-time Activities**: Live tutoring session materials

### Integration Capabilities
- **TimeBack Sync**: Optimized content delivery based on learning schedules
- **AI Tutoring**: Resource recommendations for personalized sessions
- **Progress Tracking**: Learning analytics and mastery measurement
- **QTI Compatibility**: Standardized assessment integration

## Alpha School Implementation

### For the 2-Hour Learning Model
CLR enables Alpha School's efficient learning approach by:

- **Pre-selected Content**: Curated resources optimized for rapid comprehension
- **Just-in-Time Delivery**: Materials provided exactly when needed
- **Adaptive Sequencing**: Content order based on individual learning patterns
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Track time-to-mastery for continuous improvement

### Multi-Campus Support
- **Consistent Curriculum**: Same high-quality resources across all locations
- **Local Customization**: Regional adaptations while maintaining core standards
- **Instructor Resources**: Teaching guides and support materials
- **Parent Transparency**: Family access to learning materials and progress

## Technical Architecture

### API Design
```typescript
interface CLRResource {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  type: 'text' | 'video' | 'interactive' | 'assessment';
  subject: string;
  gradeLevel: number;
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  estimatedDuration: number; // minutes
  prerequisites: string[];
  learningObjectives: string[];
  metadata: ResourceMetadata;
}

interface ResourceMetadata {
  author: string;
  createdDate: Date;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  version: string;
  tags: string[];
  accessibility: AccessibilityInfo;
}
```

### Data Flow
1. **Content Creation**: Educators author materials using CLR standards
2. **Quality Review**: Curriculum team validates resources
3. **System Integration**: Resources uploaded to CLR repository
4. **Intelligent Delivery**: AI systems recommend optimal content
5. **Usage Analytics**: Track effectiveness and student engagement

## Benefits for Alpha School

### For Administrators
- **Curriculum Oversight**: Central visibility into all learning materials
- **Quality Assurance**: Standardized review and approval processes
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce duplication and maximize resource utilization
- **Compliance Tracking**: Ensure materials meet educational standards

## Integration with Alpha School Stack

### TimeBack Integration
CLR works with TimeBack to optimize content delivery timing:
- Schedule resource access during peak learning periods
- Recommend review materials based on retention patterns
- Balance content types for optimal engagement

### AI Tutoring System
CLR provides the foundation for personalized tutoring:
- Supply materials for 1:1 tutoring sessions
- Track resource effectiveness per student
- Enable dynamic content recommendations

### Assessment Platform
CLR integrates with QTI-compliant assessment systems:
- Link learning resources to assessment items
- Provide remediation materials based on quiz results
- Support competency-based progression

## Getting Started with @superbuilders/clr

<Warning>
Package documentation may be limited as this appears to be an internal Alpha School tool. Contact the development team for implementation details.
</Warning>

### Installation
```bash
npm install @superbuilders/clr
```

### Basic Usage
```typescript
import { CLRClient } from '@superbuilders/clr';

const clr = new CLRClient({
  apiUrl: process.env.CLR_API_URL,
  apiKey: process.env.CLR_API_KEY
});

// Fetch resources for a specific subject
const mathResources = await clr.getResources({
  subject: 'mathematics',
  gradeLevel: 8,
  difficulty: 'intermediate'
});

// Get personalized recommendations
const recommendations = await clr.getRecommendations({
  studentId: 'student-123',
  learningObjective: 'algebra-basics'
});
```

## Best Practices

### Content Creation
